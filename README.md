# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates and visualizes various pathfinding algorithms, including A*, Dijkstra's, RRT, and RRT* algorithms. The algorithms are applied to a grid-based environment with obstacles and navigable paths.

## Features

- A* algorithm implementation with visualization.
- Dijkstra's algorithm implementation with visualization.
- RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) algorithm implementation with visualization.
- RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Star) algorithm implementation with visualization.
- Animation of the pathfinding process for each algorithm.
- Random grid generation for testing different scenarios.
- Ability to handle lethal cells and find paths to non-lethal cells.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

python pathfinding_visualization.py

The script will generate random grid environments and visualize the pathfinding process for each algorithm.

Customization
You can customize the grid size, start, and end points in the script.
Adjust algorithm parameters such as maximum iterations, step size, and radius to see their effects on the pathfinding process.
Modify the generate_random_grid function to create custom grid layouts.
